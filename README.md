## Laravel Project Manager Dashboard

This Laravel web application allows a privileged user to create new projects, add users as members of the project,
define individual tasks for a project, assign those tasks to Project members. Project members can view the projects they
are a members of, view and resolve tasks that are assigned to them.

This project uses Vue+Laravel with a sqlite database, and comes with a robust suite of tests written in PHPUnit.
